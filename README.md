## Description

Projects of Data Structures and Algorithm courses at Patika Academy


### Project 1
```
[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

  - Write the stages of the array given above according to the sort type.
  - Write the Big-O notation.
```
```
Time Complexity: After the array is sorted, the number 18 falls under which of the following cases?
 * Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle.
 * Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end.
 * Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the array.
```
```
Write the first 4 steps of the array [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] according to Selection Sort.
```

### Project 2
```
[16,21,11,8,12,22] -> Merge Sort

  - Write the stages of the above array according to the sort type.
  - Write the Big-O notation.
```

### Project 3
```
Write the Binary-Search-Tree stages of the array [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2].

Example: root is x. y is found to the right of the root. To the left of it is z, etc.
